        <h1>Corruption & Police misconduct</h1>
        <p>Corruption is very common in India. It is common in every section and every level of Indian society. Corruption has also become a big part of Indian politics. In India, corruption takes many forms, including:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Bribes (for example, giving money to a government worker to get them to do something illegal)</li>  
         <li>Tax evasion (not paying taxes)</li>
         <li>Not obeying exchange controls (rules made by the government about whether people can buy or sell currencies (money) from other countries)</li>
         <li>embezzlement (stealing or misusing money that belongs to a company or government)</li>    
        </ul>  
        <p>India has state laws that make it illegal for police to torture people. But these laws are not often obeyed. Torture is often used when people are arrested or jailed by the police. This torture is a major cause of deaths in police custody. The police often torture innocent people until they 'confess' (they say they did the crime). This false confession is then used to save important, rich people who have actually committed crimes. One major problem that keeps police violence possible is a lack of accountability (meaning no one gets in trouble if they torture a person), according to G.P. Joshi. Joshi runs the Indian branch of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative in New Delhi.</p>
          <p><b>Petty crime</b></p>
          <p> Petty crime, like stealing people's wallets and bags, is common in India. Stealing valuable things from foreigners' luggage on trains and buses is also common. People traveling alone are especially likely to have their things stolen by pickpockets and purse snatchers, who usually work in crowded areas</p>
          <p><b>Passport theft</b></p>
          <p>In India, stealing tourists' passports from their luggage on trains and buses is very common.[29] Theft of U.S. passports happens often, especially in major tourist areas</p> 
          <p><b>Scam incidents</b></p>
          <p>Criminals run many scams against tourists, especially in Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. The criminals usually pick younger tourists to try to scam. They tell the tourists that they can make a lot of money if they move gems or gold, or if they take expensive carpets back home in their luggage to avoid customs duties.If a tourist agrees, the scam continues for a few days. Then a new scam artist offers to show the tourist interesting places in the area. The scammers also offer cheap places to stay and meals to the tourist. They do this so that the tourist ends up being with the scam artist all the time. The scam artist is then threatened and may be hurt, until he gives up his passport to the scammers</p>
          <p><b>Taxi scam</b></p>
          <p>Taxi drivers also run scams in India. These scams are run on tourists who do not know their way around India or Indian airports. Some taxi drivers will drive tourists around the whole airport, so they can charge a lot of money for the ride, when the part of the airport that the tourist wants to go to was actually very close by. In a report, the Overseas Security Advisory Council talked about taxi scams and how to avoid them.</p>
